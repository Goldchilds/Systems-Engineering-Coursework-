# line 1-4, importing necessary libraries
# line 6-9, defining simulation parameters where 100 critical operations are being monitored per outage scenario, the UPS has an ideal failure rate of 0.1%, and 10,000 outages are simulated. 
# line 11-13, data in the above statement put into simulation
# line 15-18, the data in each simulated outage is stored in a dataframe
# line 20-22, statiscal analysis tools being integrated to quantify the uncertainty, calculating the mean and the standard deviation.

# line 31-33, calculating the probability of no failures occuring in a single outage event. 
# line 35-39, assessing impact, calculating the percentage of the 10,000 simulated outages, where at least 1 critical operation had been affected due to UPS failure.\
